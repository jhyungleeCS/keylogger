### What is a keylogger?
Keyloggers are a type of technology, hardware or software, that is designed to record user input that is typed by a user on the computer keyboard. User input can include letters, numbers, symbols, and even mouse clicks. The keyloggerâ€™s general purpose is to gather as much information as possible from what the user is typing into their keyboard. 

Keylogging can be used for both malicious and legitimate purposes. A company may use it as part of their policy to monitor user activtity on their network. However, an attacker might use a keylogger maliciously for data exfiltration on a network or collect sensitive information about a target including  their SSN, credit card numbers, and other PII information.


## The Project

To understand attacks on users vulnerable to these eavesdropping attacks, I wanted to create my own version of a hardware keylogger that can be used and installed on a removable media device. 

I first created a script in python that runs two main function on_press and Listener that were pulled from the pynput library. What these two function did, is when the script was ran, they started recording the keystrokes of the user and displaying them into a list.

Once the key.esc is pressed, the input is then saved onto a list and saved to a keylog.txt file that is displayed on your Desktop *(Changing in the future)*
